#Introspection

* ##Why must we choose you?

  I had a great intersest to join amFoss. I am a BCA graduate form Amrita itself.During those days I couldnt join in amFoss because didnt actually liked these    coding stuff or didnt take these all seriously. I realized the importance of these clubs only after I completed my graduation.When I started doing coding seriously, I started to love coding.Now I am trying to study many things as much as I can.Im sure that I could learn great things from this club(both technical and non technical).
    
* What is your plan for the next 6 months?
 
  Learn more thats the main plan.
  
* How do contribute back to the club?
 
  Now I dont have a clear answer to this because I dont know what all things I could contribute back to this club.Butt I can say that I will be much dedicated to this club.I am ready to do what all things I could do.
  
* Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
 
  I dont have any suggestions to  the selection process.I am completely fine with ths.
